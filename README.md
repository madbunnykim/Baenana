# Baenana
Baenana is an interactive XL banana that talks about modern romance.

Defying the conventions, digital age New York City’s millennial dating culture blurs the line between platonic and romantic love. Baenana unravels her intimate experience with her significant other through a seemingly innocent children’s toy. From the romantic first encounter to repetitive status speculations, Baenana contemplates the notion of true love and issues on contemporary relationships.
